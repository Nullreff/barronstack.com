    - title: Scale
      text: "If your game becomes insanely popular, what do you do?  No need to worry about buying more servers or upgrading your existing ones.  Our platform instantly adapts to changes in player volume."

      text: "Complex stuff like cross server chat, load balancing with BungeeCord and live stats tracking come built in.  Spend less time setting up and more time building awesome games to share with the world."
